<h2 class="section-heading">Online Work - Networking </h2>



<p>I will begin this Post with a Quote "Find a Job you Love and you'll never work a day in your Life." This is my Insperation and Motivation to Work everyday on my Start Up Project. " Life is too short to work for a boring company or at a boring Job. Keep up the good work and never give up." </p>


<p>And one of my most Secret to Work Online in my Network which one i have build during the last two years are: "Successful People build each other up. They motivate, inspire, and push each other. Unsuccessful People just hate, blame, and complain everything." In the last two years i have met some Developers, but most them were very crazy demotivate to work on a Project. </p>
