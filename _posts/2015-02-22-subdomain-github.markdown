<h2 class="section-heading">Setting up a custom domain with GitHub Pages</h2>




Get Ready with Sub-domain and Apex Domain @  Github. I will get a new Blog Name in the next Days or Weeks. However, i think i will do that right now, when i have more Time to do it. I have always a very nice New name in Mind. I Think it will be .io Domian Name. Maybe i will use a custome Blog Name (Apex-Domian) or a (Sub-Domian). We will see it. - 

<h2 class="section-heading">Sub Domains</h2>
A subdomain is configured with a CNAME record through your DNS provider (There where your  domain is Registered). 
We strongly recommend that you use a custom subdomain for these reasons:


It gives your GitHub Pages site the benefit of our Content Delivery Network.[Content Delivery Network. -Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)
It will not be affected by changes in the underlying IP addresses of GitHub's servers.
Pages will load significantly faster because [Denial-of-service Attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) protection can be implemented more efficiently.


<h2 class="section-heading">Apex Domains</h2>
An apex domain is usually configured with an <code>A</code>, <code>ALIAS</code>, or <code>ANAME</code> record through your DNS provider and is often assigned to one or more IP addresses.



I will set up my  Apex Domain @ Github, because i do host my Stuff and Website on Github. - There also some Points to set up one to your  Repositories. So far i have create a [User, Organization, and Project Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/). Which one can do everybody, if you have a Github account. You need also One to get Set Up your [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) .


So now we use a Apex Domain Name (www.yourdomain.com) or a Sub-Domian Name (www.hello.yourdomain.com). So we have get some Functions of the Cname.  [About custom domains for GitHub Pages sites](https://help.github.com/articles/about-custom-domains-for-github-pages-sites/)



If you're using a [Custom Domain](https://help.github.com/articles/about-custom-domains-for-github-pages-sites/) to redirect your GitHub Pages site, you must create and commit a CNAME file to your GitHub Pages repository that contains the custom domain.
[Adding a CNAME file to your Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-cname-file-to-your-repository/)



ps: I give everysite a SSL Certificate to be mostly Safe - Both types of Pages are served over HTTP, not HTTPS. You shouldn't use them for sensitive transactions, like sending passwords or credit card numbers. -
