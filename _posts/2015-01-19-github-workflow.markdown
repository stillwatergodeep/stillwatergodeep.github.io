<h2 class="section-heading">Github Introduction</h2>

Today, I gonna show you some Steps on Github using Ui from GitHub.

Download
[GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/)


Since, we work on our Start Up we use some Tools to work Faster on it.

I'm a Macuser and Work on Mac, with GitHub UI/ Desktop App for Commits and Synch my Changes on our App which one we have Branched. We have also 3 Clones up.

My Friend use Linux and there are also some Differents Way to work on it. Specially we use sails.js for our App.
We also work on ".ejs", files, but they are basically html.


In case you still can't see any updates :


git pull origin master

sudo npm update

sails lift


git add -A -> add all unstaged files to the stagin area
git commit -m "Short description of your commit" -> Commit 


the files from the staging area to the head of your local branch



git checkout {Branch Name}

to check where you are -> git status

 if you want to push -> git push origin {Branch Name}
