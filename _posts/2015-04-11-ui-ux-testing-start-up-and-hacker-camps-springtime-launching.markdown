<strong>Start Up - Current Streak</strong> This week we start with the UI / UX Interface Testing. We look much on the design and user-friendliness. Of course also includes the browser testing. I will soon give out a Contact-Form where several Developers can contact US. We want do things that have never been done before. Now, you can contact me [@LucasGatsas](https://www.twitter.com/lucasgatsas).

<strong>Call for Participation: Chaos Communication Camp 2015
 </strong> I received an invitation from a friend for the  [CCC - Camp ](http://events.ccc.de/2015/04/09/call-for-participation-chaos-communication-camp-2015/)in Mildberg Germany. Anyway, I'll probably go there.
especially I like the security area, because I'm starting a study soon.

We’d love to see your submission for these tracks:

Failosophy,
Arts & Culture,
Ethics, Society & Politics,
Hardware & Making,
Security & Hacking,
Science.


The Genius would, of course, if we can organize in the Green (Switzerland), a hacker Camp. Of course, I would invite some people over the World to Switzerland.
