<p>Happy New Year Everybody. Good Code 2015. 1. of January! Back to work! I figured out how can I do this, how can i run my dev blog here on github over https. After searching the Entire! I found out, there is a simple script! This Code is writen in Javascript. </p>


<code>var host = "YOURDOMAIN.github.io";
if ((host == window.location.host) && (window.location.protocol != "https:"))
    window.location.protocol = "https";
</code><br>


<p> Another Way you can get ssl is, during the Popular Cryptographic Software Library Open Source SSL which on is available on a Source Base !
	Be aware of the the most biggest Hole! The Heartbleed Bug! 
	There are many other Open Sources and Scripts. If you are good, you can both write your own self. 
	Here some Links :
