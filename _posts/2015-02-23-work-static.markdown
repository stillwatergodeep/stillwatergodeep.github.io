<h2 class="section-heading">Work Static</h2>


<p> Since exact from the 1. of January till now we have spend alot of Time in our Start Up. We have worked every Day on our Start Up. Now we are in the middle of our Code. Glad to have the strong Part behind us. I have done the most Front-End Work and Javascript details. I'm going to start with the Design, the Hardwork of the Design which takes a lot of Time. I needed 10 hours for Design and Layout, later I chose the main Colors, the Fonts which I have changed many Times. A good Layout and Design needs a lot of Times!</p>



<p>
My Days looks like at the Moment, Wake Up in The Morning most Time (07:00), if I slept, because in the last Days, I work during the Day and at Night. My Sleeprhythm are exactly 6 - 8 hours per Day. Nothing more.. i can't even sleep more than 6 -8 Hours per Day. Then I speak a few details with Giancarlo. Then Write some New Code and do re-design of the current Layout.

Between Start Up and Study. 
Some People ask me how do you do that? how do you can work so long..? My Answer is, I love what I do, this is the most secret. Find anything  what do you Love and make it big. starts small. everyone is beginning difficult. - this is definitely a good motivation necessary for the start. - sometimes I wish I could make other details! But everything has a Sense. Also to be alone all the Time? - I am athlete and have simply by nature much more energy in me. I love create things which one are never done before. - And you must be also too very concentrated, flexible, bouncy, discipline, well-disciplined, self-disciplined to do that and there are some Rules too, to be a good Front-End Web Weveloper/ Ui/Ux Interface Developer.
