<h2 class="section-heading">"Remove and Delete things from the Internet with Robots"</h2>


Last two Weeks, I am concerned with removing things from the Internet. First Part a Part of my Past Work and soem Details. 
Now after some trouble to remove things from the Internet. I tried to reach the Webmaster from some Website etc. but, these don't answered my Questions etc.
This was make me very confussed. After some Bomb Mails, some of these Webmaster have sended and answered me a e-mail and some Webmaster have removed the Content. 



[1.] Write to the Webmaster

[2.] Write to the Host and their Provider to find out who is behind, (if you get a answer) if not, find out self with some Tools :) !Whois LookUp, with your (Netzwerkdienstprogramm)

[3.] Find a Lawyer in your Country and City

[4.] Write to Google (if they can remove the content from their Index.)

[5.] Go to their Office. 

[6.] Write a Article about it. 


[7.] And another Way you can remove it.. is.... :) ! But these Ways are with some obstacles! The Life is in your Hand. 


At the first Moment I'm was a bit frustrated and angry about these Things! After some shaking the head  and bored about Ideas how remove it.
I wrote a robot. With the <a href="https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=sitemaps&passive=1209600&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fwebmasters%2Ftools%2Fhome%3Fhl%3Den&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fwebmasters%2Ftools%2Fhome%3Fhl%3Den&hl=en">Google Webmaster Tools </a>
Then write a <code>robots.txt</code> File <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6078399?hl=de&ref_topic=6061961">Test your Crawling</a>
Go to the <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/db.html">The Robots Database lists robot software implementations and operators.</a> and find your Perfect Bot, Spider and Crawler. :)
